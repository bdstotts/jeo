This is a program for playing a music Jeopardy game. You can play with up to 8 players or teams of players. 
After inputting the number of players or teams, you are shown a board of music Jeopardy categories and clues. These are already predefined and not easily alterable by the user.
After selecting a clue square, buttons with "play" and "submit" are spawned. 
Clicking "play" opens a browser window with the song playing in youtube. Quickly press Alt+F4 to go back to the game window and not reveal the answer. 
You may find a workaround with dual monitors. Also, you may want to hide your taskbar if that reveals the answer in a minimized window. 

After teams guess the answer, click on the score boxes that contain "Team 1:"...."Team n:" of the teams that got it correct. They will be highlighted. 
Then press "submit" to add the dollar amount to their scores. 

A double jeopardy button is hidden on the bar where the play and submit buttons are. It is barely a different color from the background and is found on the far left side. 

Does not include Daliy Double or Final Jeopardy. Darn it. 

This game is perfect for family gatherings or work functions as a team building exercise or just for fun.
